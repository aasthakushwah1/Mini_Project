      <h7>Self Defence is the act of defending oneself, one's property or someone else from physical harm. Self Defence has an important role in the life of women. Self Defence is a skill which every woman should acquire to make their own and others live safer on a daily basis or whenever the situation requires. Women often become victims because of their physical ability. Self Defence techniques enable them to take control of situations in which may end up being a victim of verbal abuse, physical attack etc. Such techniques also increase confidence in realising that if someone does not respect your boundaries, you should stop them.

        Crime is on the rise, especially among women. And it doesn’t matter where you live or work, you are at risk of becoming a victim of a violent or intrusive crime. There is only one perfect way to deal with it, is to defend your self with certain psychological, physical and Self Defence tools. Most likely, When a personal attack occurs it is very likely that the police won’t be standing nearby and also likely is the fact that the police can only get involved after the damage has been done.

While so much attention is given to Academic Education, one should not consider Self Defence as useless or redundant because just like academics is important for our future, self-defence is important for our safety.
