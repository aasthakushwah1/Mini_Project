      <h5>What is self-defense?</h5>
      <h7>We all have heard about Self-defense since we were children, and living in this brutal world of the 21st century where no one is completely safe, it comes as a responsibility that it is only us who can protect us.

        If we see the basic definition, it is protecting oneself from any external harm by defending the opponent.
        
        Self – defense use is under legal jurisdictions called as the “right to self – defense”. In today’s world, it is very important to know to protect yourself.
        
        Statistics show that one in three women will be the victim of some type of violent attack in her lifetime.  In the training, it is taught to block an attack, but if one can avoid it, it is a much better case!
        
        Hence, the training should also include preventing an attack in the first place. Which type of karate would you like to pursue to protect yourself?
        
        Knowing something as strong as Karate gives you confidence and strength that you’re not weak and has the potential to do what they dream of.

      <h5>Why learn self-defense?</h5>
          <h7>There are several reasons you might want to learn self-defense. The most obvious reason is that you want to be prepared to defend yourself or your family if you’re ever in immediate danger.

            It is very rare to run into someone who may want to cause you harm. Having no plan for how to deal with that situation leaves you exceptionally vulnerable. A study conducted by the Department of Justice and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that 1 in 6 women had experienced a sexual assault or an attempted sexual assault.
            
            For men, the numbers were 1 in 33. No attack is ever the victim’s fault and not all attacks are preventable. But we do know that learning the art of self-defense can help victims to stop or escape their attackers.
            
            Rape is only one of the situations where someone would need self-defense training. A mugging or home invasion are both situations where self-defense training would help you to better tackle the danger, defend yourself and your family, and find ways to minimize the damage the perpetrator poses.
            
            It is about learning how to defend yourself and think clearly in very intense situations. It is about gaining the confidence to better control situations that might otherwise be completely outside of your control.
            
            Slowly over the years the corporation has been aware and started conducting workshops for women in the same field. In fact, today we feel that every parent must include some self defense classes in their parenting. Along with school, art classes, swimming sessions, self-defense has become a necessity for every growing child and  individual today. Here are some parenting tips to help your child blossom.
